This is the homepage of Anatoly Sorokin.

I hold a PhD Degree from the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics RAS. 

In 2005-2011 I was a research fellow of the Scottish Centre for Systems Biology The University of Edinburg. 

From 2014-2019 I was head of the Laboratory of Mechanisms of Genome Functioning in the Institute of the Cell Biophysics RAS. 

Currently, I'm in Okinawa, Japan, working as a Senior Computational Biologist in 
Biological Systems Unit in the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology.

My research interests include graph-based analysis; 
analysis of multi-omics data, including metagenomics, metabolomics and lipidomics;
constraint-base, dynamical and rule-based modelling and application areas include systems biology, bioinformatics and microbiomics.
