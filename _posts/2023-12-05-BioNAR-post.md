Another paper describing the  [BioNAR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/BioNAR.html) package is published in the [CURRENT PROTOCOLS](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.940).

The paper provides practical examples of various network analysis techniques implemented in the BioNAR package version from Bioconductor release 3.17. That techniques include a common graph-based algorithms such as calculation node centralities, clustering etc. But it also includes state-of-art methods such as calculation annotation co-occurence, and a semi-automated selection of the most meaningful clustering algorithm, based on the prior information stored as a node annotation.
