Flux-based analysis (FBA) of whole-genome metabolic reconstructions (GEM) stands as a 
computational method at the forefront of systems biology and metabolic engineering. 
The essence of FBA lies in its ability to provide a quantitative framework, offering 
predictions and insights into the dynamic flow of metabolites through cellular metabolic pathways under specific environmental or physiological conditions.

In practical terms, FBA allows researchers to simulate and predict how an organism's 
metabolism responds to various conditions. For example, FBA can be used to analyze how 
changes in nutrient availability, genetic modifications, or environmental factors 
influence the distribution of metabolic fluxes. This predictive capability is particularly 
valuable in metabolic engineering, where researchers aim to design or optimize microbial 
strains for the production of specific compounds, such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, or 
industrial chemicals.

Another area of the active use of FBA models is in the medical application. Development of the human metabolic reconstruction ([1](http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2488),[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/msb4100177)) 
and reorganization it with tissue specific submodels into integrated whole-body model ([3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/msb.20198982)) 
open the avenue for a better understanding of the pathological processes such as cancer 
development. Apart from human GEM, number of large collection of models were created by manual curation ([4](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkz1054/5614178)), 
semi-automated reconstruction ([5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01628-0)), 
or fully-automated reconstruction (see in [6](http://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0446-y)) techniques. 

What is common between all such reconstructions, as was noted by Van Pelt-KleinJan with coauthors ([7](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/5/257)), 
is that all of them are based on experimental flux data from limited media growth. This is 
reasonable from experimental point of view, as single carbon source experiment allows to 
compare experimental growth rate with essentiality data from the model. But that type of 
model identification impose some limitations to the interpretation of the model results in 
nutrient-rich set up. The rich environment is very common as in biotechnological 
application, for example in the food industry and when bacteria participate in the 
community and interact with its members by production and consumption of nutrients. The 
interaction between pathways utilizing different substrates make solution space more 
complex and increase number of non-unique solutions to the optimization FBA problem. In 
this talk we propose to solve this problem with the new approach ([8](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/3/500)), 
which is based on sampling flux space and global sensitivity analysis (GSA), for analysis 
of the GEM FBA solution space in the nutrient-rich environment.
