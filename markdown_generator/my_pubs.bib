@article{Kenney:2015Dynamics,
	abstract = {The rapid regulation of cell signaling in response to calcium in neurons is essential for real-time processing of large amounts of information in the brain. A vital regulatory component, and one of the most energy-intensive biochemical processes in cells, is the elongation phase of mRNA translation, which is controlled by the Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). However, little is known about the dynamics of eEF2K regulation in neurons despite its established role in learning and synaptic plasticity. To explore eEF2K dynamics in depth, we stimulated synaptic activity in mouse primary cortical neurons. We find that synaptic activity results in a rapid, but transient, increase in eEF2K activity that is regulated by a combination of AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptors and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways. We then used computational modeling to test the hypothesis that considering Ca(2+)-coordinated MEK/ERK, mTORC1, and eEF2k activation is sufficient to describe the observed eEF2K dynamics. Although such a model could partially fit the empirical findings, it also suggested that a crucial positive regulator of eEF2K was also necessary. Through additional modeling and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that AMP kinase (AMPK) is also an important regulator of synaptic activity-driven eEF2K dynamics in neurons. Our combined modeling and experimental findings provide the first evidence that it is necessary to consider the combined interactions of Ca(2+) with MEK/ERK, mTORC1, and AMPK to adequately explain eEF2K regulation in neurons.},

@article{Khilyas:2017Comparative,
	abstract = {Bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are promising new technologies for efficient removal of organic compounds from industrial wastewaters, including that generated from swine farming. We inoculated two pairs of laboratory-scale MFCs with sludge granules from a beer wastewater-treating anaerobic digester (IGBS) or from sludge taken from the bottom of a tank receiving swine wastewater (SS). The SS-inoculated MFC outperformed the IGBS-inoculated MFC with regard to COD and VFA removal and electricity production. Using a metagenomic approach, we describe the microbial diversity of the MFC planktonic and anodic communities derived from the different inocula. Proteobacteria (mostly Deltaproteobacteria) became the predominant phylum in both MFC anodic communities with amplification of the electrogenic genus Geobacter being the most pronounced. Eight dominant and three minor species of Geobacter were found in both MFC anodic communities. The anodic communities of the SS-inoculated MFCs had a higher proportion of Clostridium and Bacteroides relative to those of the IGBS-inoculated MFCs, which were enriched with Pelobacter. The archaeal populations of the SS- and IGBS-inoculated MFCs were dominated by Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, respectively. Our results show a long-term influence of inoculum type on the performance and microbial community composition of swine wastewater-treating MFCs.},

@article{Orlov:2018Comparative,
	abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum is an intracellular parasite affecting respiratory tract of poultry that belongs to class Mollicutes. M. gallisepticum features numerous variable lipoprotein hemagglutinin genes (vlhA) that play a role in immune escape. The vlhA promoters have a set of distinct properties in comparison to promoters of the other genes. The vlhA promoters carry a variable GAA repeats region at approximately 40 nts upstream of transcription start site. The promoters have been considered active only in the presence of exactly 12 GAA repeats. The mechanisms of vlhA expression regulation and GAA number variation are not described. Here we tried to understand these mechanisms using different computational methods. We conducted a comparative analysis among several M. gallisepticum strains. Nucleotide sequences analysis showed the presence of highly conserved regions flanking repeated trinucleotides that are not linked to GAA number variation. VlhA genes with 12 GAA repeats and their orthologs in 12 M. gallisepticum strains are more conserved than other vlhA genes and have narrower GAA number distribution. We conducted comparative analysis of physicochemical profiles of M. gallisepticum vlhA and sigma-70 promoters. Stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) profiles showed that sigma-70 group is characterized by the common to prokaryotic promoters sharp maxima while vlhA promoters are hardly destabilized with the region between GAA repeats and transcription start site having zero opening probability. Electrostatic potential profiles of vlhA promoters indicate the presence of the distinct patterns that appear to govern initial stages of specific DNA-protein recognition. Open state dynamics profiles of vlhA demonstrate the pattern that might facilitate transcription bubble formation. Obtained data could be the basis for experimental identification of mechanisms of phase variation in M. gallisepticum.},

	abstract = {Distribution of electrostatic potential of DNA fragments was evaluated. A method for calculation of electrostatic potential distribution based on Coulomb's law is proposed for long DNA fragments (approximately 1000 nucleotide pairs). For short DNA sequences, this technique provides a good correlation with the results obtained using Poisson-Boltzmann equation thus justifying its application in comparative studies for long DNA fragments. Calculation was performed for several DNA fragments from E. coli and bacteriophage T7 genomes containing promoter and nonpromoter regions. The results obtained indicate that coding regions are characterized by more homogeneous distribution of electrostatic potential whereas local inhomogeneity of DNA electrostatic profile is typical for promoter regions. The possible role of electrostatic interactions in RNA polymerase-promoter recognition is discussed.},

	abstract = {Predicting promoter activity of DNA fragment is an important task for computational biology. Approaches using physical properties of DNA to predict bacterial promoters have recently gained a lot of attention. To select an adequate set of physical properties for training a classifier, various characteristics of DNA molecule should be taken into consideration. Here, we present a systematic approach that allows us to select less correlated properties for classification by means of both correlation and cophenetic coefficients as well as concordance matrices. To prove this concept, we have developed the first classifier that uses not only sequence and static physical properties of DNA fragment, but also dynamic properties of DNA open states. Therefore, the best performing models with accuracy values up to 90\% for all types of sequences were obtained. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the classifier can serve as a reliable tool enabling promoter DNA fragments to be distinguished from promoter islands despite the similarity of their nucleotide sequences.},

Therefore, bovine mastitis is relevant to the study of microbiology and veterinary medicine. In this study, we investigated the microbiome of milk samples from healthy cows and cows with different forms of mastitis from individual quarters of the udder of cows during first and second lactation. Total DNA was extracted from milk samples. The V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes from each sample were amplified to generate a library via high-throughput sequencing. We revealed significant dominance of several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding mostly to groups of Staphylococcus aureus, Aerococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. In addition, we unexpectedly identified Streptococcus thermophilus in samples with high SCC quantities. We found some infectious agents that characterized summer mastitis. We demonstrated that in Central Russia, mastitis is associated with a wide variety of causal organisms. We observed some differences in the diversity of the two investigated farms. However, we did not find any significant difference among healthy, mastitis and subclinical samples according to their SCC status from either farms by principal component analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) confirmed the presence of several indicator genera in farms from Moscow and the Tula Region. These results confirm the complex bacterial etiology of bovine mastitis.},

	abstract = {A comparative analysis of electrostatic patterns for 359 sigma70-specific promoters and 359 nonpromoter regions on electrostatic map of Escherichia coli genome was carried out. It was found that DNA is not a uniformly charged molecule. There are some local inhomogeneities in its electrostatic profile which correlate with promoter sequences. Electrostatic patterns of promoter DNAs can be specified due to the presence of some distinctive motifs which differ for different promoter groups and may be involved as signal elements in differential recognition of various promoters by the enzyme. Some specific electrostatic elements which are responsible for modulating promoter activities due to ADP-ribosylation of RNA polymerase alpha-subunit were found in far upstream regions of T4 phage early promoters and E. coli ribosomal promoters.},

@article{Szydlowski:2020Evolutionary,
	abstract = {Bio-electrochemical systems can generate electricity by virtue of mature microbial consortia that gradually and spontaneously optimize performance. To evaluate selective enrichment of these electrogenic microbial communities, five, 3-electrode reactors were inoculated with microbes derived from rice wash wastewater and incubated under a range of applied potentials. Reactors were sampled over a 12-week period and DNA extracted from anodic, cathodic, and planktonic bacterial communities was interrogated using a custom-made bioinformatics pipeline that combined 16S and metagenomic samples to monitor temporal changes in community composition. Some genera that constituted a minor proportion of the initial inoculum dominated within weeks following inoculation and correlated with applied potential. For instance, the abundance of Geobacter increased from 423-fold to 766-fold between -350 mV and -50 mV, respectively. Full metagenomic profiles of bacterial communities were obtained from reactors operating for 12 weeks. Functional analyses of metagenomes revealed metabolic changes between different species of the dominant genus, Geobacter, suggesting that optimal nutrient utilization at the lowest electrode potential is achieved via genome rearrangements and a strong inter-strain selection, as well as adjustment of the characteristic syntrophic relationships. These results reveal a certain degree of metabolic plasticity of electrochemically active bacteria and their communities in adaptation to adverse anodic and cathodic environments.},

Multiple models of human metabolism have been reconstructed, but each represents only a subset of our knowledge. Here we describe Recon 2, a community-driven, consensus 'metabolic reconstruction', which is the most comprehensive representation of human metabolism that is applicable to computational modeling. Compared with its predecessors, the reconstruction has improved topological and functional features, including {$\sim$}2\texttimes{} more reactions and {$\sim$}1.7\texttimes{} more unique metabolites. Using Recon 2 we predicted changes in metabolite biomarkers for 49 inborn errors of metabolism with 77\% accuracy when compared to experimental data. Mapping metabolomic data and drug information onto Recon 2 demonstrates its potential for integrating and analyzing diverse data types. Using protein expression data, we automatically generated a compendium of 65 cell type\textendash specific models, providing a basis for manual curation or investigation of cell-specific metabolic properties.

The technique of classification of tumor tissues based on mass spectrometric profile data processing is suggested in this paper. Classifiers dividing the researched sample to the corresponding tissue type were created as a result of the processing. Classifiers of necrotic and tumor tissues are shown to yield a combined result when the tissue is heterogeneous and consists of both tumor cells and necrotic tissue.},

The effect of differences between research and clinical protocols such as low- and high-resolution measurements and sample storage have to be understood and taken into account to transfer methods from bench to bedside. In this study, we demonstrate a simple way to compare mass spectra obtained by different experimental protocols, assess its quality, and check for the presence of outliers and batch effect in the dataset. We compare the mass spectra of both fresh and frozen-thawed astrocytic brain tumor samples obtained with the inline cartridge extraction prior to electrospray ionization. Our results reveal the importance of both positive and negative ion mode mass spectrometry for getting reliable information about sample diversity. We show that positive mode highlights the difference between protocols of mass spectra measurement, such as fresh and frozen-thawed samples, whereas negative mode better characterizes the histological difference between samples. We also show how the use of similarity spectrum matrix helps to identify the proper choice of the measurement parameters, so data collection would be kept reliable, and analysis would be correct and meaningful.},

	abstract = {Recently developed methods of ambient ionization allow the collection of mass spectrometric datasets for biological and medical applications at an unprecedented pace. One of the areas that could employ such analysis is neurosurgery. The fast in situ identification of dissected tissues could assist the neurosurgery procedure. In this paper tumor tissues of astrocytoma and glioblastoma are compared. The vast majority of the data representation methods are hard to use, as the number of features is high and the amount of samples is limited. Furthermore, the ratio of features and samples number restricts the use of many machine learning methods. The number of features could be reduced through feature selection algorithms or dimensionality reduction methods. Different algorithms of dimensionality reduction are considered along with the traditional noise thresholding for the mass spectra. From our analysis, the Isomap algorithm appears to be the most effective dimensionality reduction algorithm for negative mode, whereas the positive mode could be processed with a simple noise reduction by a threshold. Also, negative and positive mode correspond to different sample properties: negative mode is responsible for the inner variability and the details of the sample, whereas positive mode describes measurement in general.},
